(* Days of the week *)

Inductive day : Type :=
  | monday : day
  | tuesday : day
  | wednesday : day
  | thursday : day
  | friday : day
  | saturday : day
  | sunday : day.

Definition next_weekday (d:day) : day :=
  match d with
    | monday => tuesday
    | tuesday => wednesday
    | wednesday => thursday
    | thursday => friday
    | friday => monday
    | saturday => monday
    | sunday => monday
  end.

Eval compute in (next_weekday friday).
Eval compute in (next_weekday (next_weekday saturday)).

Example test_next_weekday:
  (next_weekday (next_weekday saturday)) = tuesday.

Proof. simpl. reflexivity. Qed.

(* Booleans *)

Inductive bool : Type :=
  | true : bool
  | false : bool.

Definition negb (b:bool) : bool :=
  match b with
    | true => false
    | false => true
  end.

Definition andb (b1:bool) (b2:bool) : bool :=
  match b1 with
    | true => b2
    | false => false
  end.

Definition orb (b1:bool) (b2:bool) : bool :=
  match b1 with
    | true => true
    | false => b2

Proof. reflexivity. Qed.
Example test_orb2: (orb false false) = false.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.
Example test_orb3: (orb false true) = true.
